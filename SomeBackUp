The actual box and lid are easy to figure out and assemble without them, however the crates that separate the ornaments took a little longer to figure out. Unfortunately, my order was missing one of the handles that go on each side of the box. The reviewer before me wrote that their order came with too many pieces, I wonder if my missing handle is there. :) I'm so not impressed with this product and cannot recommend it."
